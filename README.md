# Streamer [ON HOLD]
Simple Radio Streamer

The project will continue in the near future or further, (whichever comes last). Code is not ready for usage, please be patient.
## Why this Project
Was listening to radio on an app and got pissed with my favoriite programs and music being interrupted by ads every now and then. I went rogue
## Notes
This is curated to my needs but open sourced no strings attached for you to work out your Magic. Power of Open source.
## Issues
working on stream conversion

Notification still basic
